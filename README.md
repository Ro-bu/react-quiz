## Objectives & Outcomes

The main goal for this project was to create a memory quiz app that fetches questions and answers from the [Open Trivia Databse](https://opentdb.com/). The design was based on a [figma file](.com/file/xncUPh3fDUDqvz7qsNvXOs/Quizzical-App-(Copy)) that I adjusted based on the extra features I added.

Beyond that, other learning outcomes were:

- Further comprehension of state management
